# 🏠 PGLens  
### An AI-Powered PG Transparency Platform

PGLens is a full-stack web application designed to bring **transparency, trust, and data-driven insights** to the student accommodation ecosystem. The platform helps students and parents make informed decisions while selecting Paying Guest (PG) accommodations by addressing common issues such as misleading claims, poor hygiene, inconsistent pricing, and lack of verified reviews.

By leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, PGLens converts unstructured information like user reviews and images into structured, explainable insights. The system focuses on reducing information asymmetry in the PG market and improving overall accountability and reliability.
